Build an index usable in any page or post. The first version uses a defined category to get only posts of that category.

== Description ==

By this plugin, you can build a alphabetically sorted index like:

A
> A post
> A second post

D
> Do you really like that?

H
> How to do something

Each post title is directly linked to the post permalink and can have different additional information.

What comes next?

* Translation from German to English
* Freely definable additional information (handled via custom fields)
* An admin page to manage the plugin settings
* Or any idea, you post me :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<!--post-index-->` in your page or post to display the index
