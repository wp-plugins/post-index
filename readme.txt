Build an index of all posts found for a specific category and display it in any page or post. The first version is limited to one category which can be defined in the admin section of the plugin.

== Description ==

By this plugin, you can build a alphabetically sorted index like:

A
> A post
> A second post

D
> Do you really like that?

H
> How to do something

Each post title is directly linked to the post permalink and can have different additional information.

What comes next?

* Translation from German to English
* Category to be defined in the <!--post-index--> include tag.
* Additional text from custom fields and an admin setting to change the link name
* Or any idea, you post me :)
